## Setup
New git branch with task name and nickname.
Use standalone ATmega328P chip (not a ready-made module).

## Goal: Design a minimal Arduino-compatible board with bootloader support.

## Tasks
Create schematic including ATmega328P, crystal oscillator, reset circuit, and power circuit.
Add FTDI or USB-UART header for programming.
Layout the PCB with good trace spacing and labeling.
Add silkscreen with pin labels.
Include optional LED on a GPIO pin.
Write a mini manual on uploading sketches to this board.

## Submit: Schematics, layout, Gerbers, photos/renders, documentation (PDF or MD).
## Estimated time: 2 weeks
